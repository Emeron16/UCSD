The repository contains datasets for hand gestures. 

Background:
Hand gestures can serve as intuitive and efficient remote commands for controlling various devices and systems, especially in environments where physical touch is impractical or impossible. By developing accurate gesture recognition models, this project aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency in controlling devices such as smart TVs, virtual reality interfaces, or industrial machinery. Solving this problem could help revolutionize user interfaces, making technology more accessible to individuals with disabilities and improving user experience across various interactive platforms.

Purpose: The dataset will be used to train an algorithm to recognize the commands given by hand gestures.
